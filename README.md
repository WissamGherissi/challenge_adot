#### utils.py: a python file containing implemented functions that will be used in the jupyter notebook

How to use:
- All the work and evaluation is contained in the notebook, launch the notebook and install the required modules to successfully run the notebook and explore the work done during this challenge, with a few parameter initializations, there is multiple possibilities to try different models for fitting on the data
